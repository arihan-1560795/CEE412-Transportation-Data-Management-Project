# Transportation Data Pipeline Implementation

## Tools used
- Vertabelo, LucidChart for Data Modelling, ER Diagrams
- SQL (MS SQL Server) for storing data
- Excel, RStudio (Shiny) Visualizing Data; interactive tool for finding properties

## About Project
The project involved creating a data pipeline for transportation data. It involved developing an ER diagram and normalizing relationships while optimizing query performance, creating tables and importing data into them using SQL, and a dashboard using R that contained a form which appended submitted data to our SQL DB, and created plotted a bicycle count on an interactive map.
